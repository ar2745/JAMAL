On March 19, 2025, Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse announced that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had dropped its appeal in the regulator\u2019s case against Ripple. Shortly after, Bitnomial said it was dropping it\u2019s own case against SEC. More than that, the crypto derivatives exchange revealed the launch of its XRP( XRP ) futures contract, the product that informed the lawsuit against the then Gary Gensler led SEC. With the SEC now under new leadership and a pro-crypto stance under President Donald Trump, Bitnomial is moving forward with its product rollout.
